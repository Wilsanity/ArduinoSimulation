Mid-Late September: Dilan, Dylan, and Michael took the idea for the project and began
writing the abstract and background info sections before moving towards researching 
other solutions. Michael also crafted our ideas for the design thinking process and 
setup the GitHub repository as well as making our Unity scene setup.

Early October: Dilan began getting Arduino parts and creating the Tinkercad simulation
as well as physical components. Dylan was formatting the document while Michael was preparing our in-class presentation with Dilan. Dilan and Michael also helped format the document.
